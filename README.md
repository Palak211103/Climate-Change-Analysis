# Climate-Change-Analysis
Analyzed climate change using Excel, SQL, and Tableau by studying AQI, temperature, precipitation, and weather data. Cleaned and queried datasets to identify trends and seasonal patterns, and created interactive dashboards to visualize climate impacts and pollution relationships.
# 🌍 Climate Change Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing climate change patterns across multiple countries using **Excel, SQL, and Tableau**. The analysis examines key environmental indicators such as **temperature, precipitation, and air quality (AQI)** to identify long-term trends, seasonal variations, and pollution–climate relationships. Interactive dashboards were created in Tableau to effectively communicate insights and support data-driven decision-making.
